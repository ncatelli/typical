# typical
A toy typesystem built to better understand type checkers. This is HEAVILY influenced by the excellent work on [RustTyC](https://github.com/Schwenger/RustTyC) and on [CubitML](https://github.com/Storyyeller/cubiml-demo) by Robert Grosse.

## Warning
Please nobody use this. This is entirely an experiment to learn more about type checkers.
