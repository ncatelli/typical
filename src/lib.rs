//! This crate functions as a test/toy implementation of a lattice type checker
//! heavily inspired by the work Maximilian Schwenger on RustTyC. While the
//! plan is to use this to support the other first principals projects, I would
//! heavily advice against anyone attempting to use any part of this.

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    #[test]
    fn it_works() {
        assert_eq!(2 + 2, 4);
    }
}
