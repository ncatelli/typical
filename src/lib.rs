//! This crate functions as a test/toy implementation of a lattice type checker
//! heavily inspired by the work Maximilian Schwenger on RustTyC. While the
//! plan is to use this to support the other first principals projects, I would
//! heavily advice against anyone attempting to use any part of this.
